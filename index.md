## Athletic Registration
All athletes must complete an online Athletic Registration Registration is available online [here](http://gunn.pausd.org/athletics/sports-news/athletics-registration). If an athlete has already participated in a sport at Gunn this school year, then the athlete does not need to complete another registration.
## Practice Times
Practice is **20 minutes** after the last academic bell! Meet at the Track.
## Athletic Donation
Thanks to those of you who have turned in your APD. Please, send a check made out to Gunn hs memo cross country... or donate [online](http://gunnboosters.corecommerce.com/scholarship-additional-and-team-donations.html). The suggested amount is $200 but any amount is appreciated. This year the contributions have ranged from $10 to $1000.
## Help Wanted
Help wanted! If you enjoyed helping in the past or wish you had had a chance, itâ€™s not too late. We need 8 parents (or more) to help us out at the League Meet. All schools are assigned jobs. Specifically we need help at the finish line and with the girls long jump and triple jump. We would like to let Coach Jordan actually coach instead of running those events. Please let me know if you can help us out.
