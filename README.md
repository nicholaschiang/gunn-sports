# Gunn Sports Website Remake
This is a remake of the original Gunn Sports Website (which can be found and laughed at [here](https://sites.google.com/a/pausd.org/gunn-cross-country/home))... And as, for the most part, I'm really quite lazy, I just forked most of this off of the original Gunn [website](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-remake/#) remake. Below is their very knowledgeable and concise description for the original [repo](https://github.com/Orbiit/gunn-remake):

### Orbiit Gunn Website Remake
Using only HTML and CSS (because we're too lazy to deal with JavaScript), we're going to make the [Gunn Website](http://gunn.pausd.org/) from scratch

There's a template design that will be the standard design for most of the pages which you can preview [here](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-remake/templates/t01.html).

There's also the [second template](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-remake/templates/t02.html). Then we combined the first two to make [this mess](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-remake/templates/t03.html).
